Arch as code project is to manage **product architecture as code**. 

By following this approach we will be able to **manage our architecture documents, models, decisions and diagrams** in the same way we do code and gain all the **tools and workflows supporting modern development**. Think PR reviews, static code analysis, continuous integration & continuous deployment.

Specifically we are making use of the [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) tool by Simon Brown as the basis for structuring and storing our architecture models, decisions, views and documentation.

# Getting Started 

## 0. Create Structurizr Account

See Structurizr [getting started](https://structurizr.com/help/getting-started) guide on how to setup a new account and get a free workspace.

## 1. Install arch-as-code cli

Arch as code required Java 8 or greater to be installed.

You can download the latest binary [here](https://github.com/nahknarmi/arch-as-code/releases/latest).

Alternatively you can run commands below for your respective OS.

### Mac OSX & Linux

```bash
mkdir -p ~/arch-as-code && curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/nahknarmi/arch-as-code/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" | xargs curl -L | tar --strip-components 1 -x -C ~/arch-as-code

export PATH=$PATH:~/arch-as-code/bin

arch-as-code --help
```

### Windows

```powershell
$download_url = (Invoke-WebRequest "https://api.github.com/repos/nahknarmi/arch-as-code/releases/latest" | ConvertFrom-Json).assets.browser_download_url

(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($download_url, "$env:temp\arch-as-code.tar.gz")  

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $HOME\arch-as-code

tar -xzv --strip-components 1 -f $env:temp\arch-as-code.tar.gz -C $HOME\arch-as-code\

$Env:Path += ";$HOME\arch-as-code\bin"

arch-as-code --help
```


## 2. Configure Structurizr workspace details

Initialize arch-as-code using information available Structurizr workspace (available from [dashboard]([dashboard](https://structurizr.com/dashboard))):

```
mkdir -p <PATH_TO_STORE_ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION>

cd <PATH_TO_STORE_ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION>

arch-as-code init -i <WORKSPACE_ID> -k <WORKSPACE_API_KEY> -s <WORKSPACE_API_SECRET> .
```

## 3. Publish changes to Structurizr
```
cd <PATH_TO_STORE_ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION>

arch-as-code publish .
```

## 4. View your changes on Structurizr

Go to [https://structurizr.com/workspace/<YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID>] to view changes you've made.

# Development

## Build Pre-requisites
- Java 1.8 or greater.
- Create [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) credentials file under `.arch-as-code/structurizr/credentials.json`. 
You can find sample file under `src/main/resources/sample_credentials.json` and update with contents. 
You can find workspaces specific keys from [https://structurizr.com/dashboard](https://structurizr.com/) 

## Build

Builds and tests application code for publishing architecture data structure to Structurizr.

Tests operate against a "test" Structurizr workspace.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment

Continuous integration is currently being done using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/nahknarmi/arch-as-code/actions).

Continuous deployment (publishing documentation) is currently being done using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/nahknarmi/arch-as-code/actions). 

GitHub Actions configuration is captured under `.github/workflows/`

## Structurizr Notes
- In order to get the API keys & secret you need to first create a workspace
- [Structurizr Java example](https://github.com/structurizr/java-quickstart)
- [API documentation](https://structurizr.com/help/web-api)
- [Structurizr open API docs](https://structurizr.com/static/assets/structurizr-api.yaml)
