    title: "Treat Structurizr WorkSpace published artifact"
    status: Accepted
    content: "## Context\nModifying the json version of Workspace is a poor experience.\n\n## Decision\nWe will treat yml architecture data structure as the 'source' to generate and publish the Structurizr workplace 'artificat'. Structurizr Cloud Service will continue to persit state and provide a read-only view.\n\n## Consequences\nWe will not checkin any workspace json files. We will not provide 2 way sync. We will not use the revision numbers in Structurizr, rather relying on git for versioning and tagging."
