## Functional Overview

Arch as code project is to manage **product architecture as code**. 

By following this approach we will be able to **manage our architecture documents, models, decisions and diagrams** in the same way we do code and gain all the **tools and workflows supporting modern development**. Think PR reviews, static code analysis, continuous integration & continuous deployment.

Specifically we are making use of the [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) tool by Simon Brown as the basis for structuring and storing our architecture models, decisions, views and documentation.

### Use Cases

1. Manual Testers should read product architecture before beginning testing.
1. TPMs should also be reading product architecture.
